              been looking to make a transition and have heard some people who
              had an amazing experience here. i signed up for the free intro
              course and found it incredibly fun! i emrolled shortly thereafter.
              the next 12 weeks was the best-and most grueling-time of my life.
              since completing the course' i've successfully switched careers,
              working as a software Engineer ar VR startup."

              "Before joining the bootcamp, i've never weitten a line of code. i
              needed some structure from professionals who can help me learn
              programming step by step. i was encouraged to enroll by a fromer
              student of theirs who can only say wonderful things about the
              program. the entire curriculum and staff did not disappoint. they
              were very hands-on and i never had to wait long for assistance.
              The agile team project, in particular, was outstanding. it took my
              learning to the next level in a way that no turorial could ever
              have. in fact, i've often referred to it during interviews as an
              example fo my developent experience. it certanily helped me land a
              job as a full-stack developer after raceiving multiple offers,
              100% recommend!"
